# Dotfiles, Programs and Dependencies

This repo contains dotbot as a submodule for managing dotfiles. Aditionally, it also contains bash scripts for installing programs and dependencies that I use on my working machine.

Dotfiles is every developers longest project as it is always subject to change and customization.
